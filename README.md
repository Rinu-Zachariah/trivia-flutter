A cross-platform Flutter app for learning with Trivia Flashcards. The app fetches the live question for Open Trivia Database.

This simple Trivia App was built to learn Flutter:
- Widget composition
- Async API calls
- Basic state management
- Navigation and screen handling

It’s not a production app, it’s my first hands-on with Flutter to understand the framework fundamentals.

Next, I’ll dive deeper into Riverpod, GoRouter, and testing for scalable Flutter apps.

If you’ve explored Flutter coming from a web background, I’d love to hear your experience!
